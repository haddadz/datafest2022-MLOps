By adopting an MLOps approach, data scientists and machine learning engineers can collaborate and **increase the pace** of model development and production, by implementing continuous integration and deployment **(CI/CD) practices** with proper **monitoring**, **validation**, and **governance** of ML models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"88b665c8-f6f2-4aad-8138-f174bd03122f","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## Why do we need MLOps?\n","\n","- Productionizing machine learning is difficult. The **machine learning lifecycle** consists of many *complex* components such as data ingest, data prep, model training, model tuning, model deployment, model monitoring, explainability, and much more. \n","- It also requires collaboration and hand-offs across teams, from Data Engineering to Data Science to ML Engineering. Naturally, it requires *stringent operational rigor* to keep all these processes synchronous and working in tandem. \n","- MLOps encompasses the experimentation, iteration, and continuous improvement of the machine learning lifecycle."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a378b5cc-38c5-4ec1-8fb5-c0559823c1b3","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## What are the benefits of MLOps?\n","\n","- The primary benefits of MLOps are efficiency, scalability, and risk reduction. \n","- Efficiency: MLOps allows data teams to achieve faster model development, deliver higher quality ML models, and faster deployment and production. \n","- Scalability: MLOps also enables vast scalability and management where thousands of models can be overseen, controlled, managed, and monitored for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. Specifically, MLOps provides reproducibility of ML pipelines, enabling more tightly-coupled collaboration across data teams, reducing conflict with devops and IT, and accelerating release velocity. \n","- Risk reduction: Machine learning models often need regulatory scrutiny and drift-check, and MLOps enables greater transparency and faster response to such requests and ensures greater compliance with an organization’s or industry’s policies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"1b4a3838-b5c4-4e01-93ef-03570cf3aed7","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## What are the components of MLOps?\n","\n","![comps](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MLOps-Components.png)\n","\n","\n","The span of MLOps in machine learning projects can be as focused or expansive as the project demands.

Most importantly, make the features visible and shareable across data teams, leveraging a feature store.\n","- Model training and tuning - Use popular open source libraries such as scikit-learn and hyperopt to train and improve model performance. As a simpler alternative, use automated machine learning tools such as AutoML to automatically perform trial runs and create reviewable and deployable code.\n","- Model review and governance- Track model lineage, model versions, and manage model artifacts and transitions through their lifecycle. Discover, share, and collaborate across ML models with the help of an open source MLOps platform such as MLflow.\n","- Model inference and serving - Manage the frequency of model refresh, inference request times and similar production-specifics in testing and QA. Use CI/CD tools such as repos and orchestrators (borrowing devops principles) to automate the pre-production pipeline.\n","- Model deployment and monitoring - Automate permissions and cluster creation to productionize registered models. Enable REST API model endpoints.\n","- Automated model retraining - Create alerts and automation to take corrective action In case of model drift due to differences in training and inference data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"0861a60d-9219-45b6-aaff-51b2d05631d5","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## What is the difference between MLOps and DevOps?\n","\n","MLOps is a set of engineering practices specific to machine learning projects that borrow from the more widely-adopted DevOps principles in software engineering.
